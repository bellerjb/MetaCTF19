| Web Exploitation | Router: Redux           | I've made a new maze of HTTP 302 pages and hid the flag in four parts throughout the maze. Can you find all the pieces and put them together?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You might not always want to follow the website's requests.                       | Difficult      |
| Programming      | Pseudorandom Repetition | I've been working on a program that needs lots of random numbers, so I wrote a Linear Congruential Generator to make them. A LCG is a kind of pseudorandom number generator where the next value n equals a times the previous n, plus c, mod m. I picked a LCG because it was simple, but LCGs eventually repeat themselves. Given the values a, c, m, and the initial seed i, compute the period of the generator, as well as the first value to repeat. | Watch out for your program's complexity.                                          | Medium         |
| Cryptography     | Cracking RSA?           | n = 1012507844500600185959897393293308058450981501, e = 65538, c = 872504627408654417593657062924385962103340788. Good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The message is encoded in octal.
