# Deep Run MetaCTF 2019
This repository contains my problems, as well as their intended solutions for
Deep Run High School's 2019 MetaCTF competition. Each problem is organized in
it's own folder, and has its own README with more detail about each problem.

| Programming      | Gotta Go Fast!          | Sometimes, programmers have the need for speed. We needs fast in and even faster out. If you can't handle our speed, don't even try. To prove that you write fast code, I have this cool string that I am passing in, and I need you to tell it back to me, but I need it fast. How fast can you go? Hopefully faster than 50ms.                                                                                                                           | You might not be able to do this in your favorite language.                           | Easy           |
| Programming      | Pseudorandom Repetition | I've been working on a program that needs lots of random numbers, so I wrote a Linear Congruential Generator to make them. A LCG is a kind of pseudorandom number generator where the next value n equals a times the previous n, plus c, mod m. I picked a LCG because it was simple, but LCGs eventually repeat themselves. Given the values a, c, m, and the initial seed i, compute the period of the generator, as well as the first value to repeat. | Watch out for your program's complexity.                                              | Medium         |
| Programming      | This Before That        | An important step to getting things done is identifying what actually needs to be done. Even though we are the omnipotent problem writers, we still need some order so we can get our tasks done. Many of our tasks rely on other tasks, so we need to plan how to go about making the event run smoothly. For future competitions, can you write a program to help organize our timing for us?                                                            | Honestly, this banDAGe still can't fix our lack of organization.                      | Medium         |
| Recon            | Vandelay Industries     | I heard from my friend George that Vandelay Industries has started to pivot into the flag generation business (I guess latex sales are declining). Can you get into their employee portal and send one of their sweet, sweet flags over?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | I heard they outsourced the development of their website to some high school student. | Medium         |
| Web Exploitation | Router: Redux           | I've made a new maze of HTTP 302 pages and hid the flag in four parts throughout the maze. Can you find all the pieces and put them together?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You might not always want to follow the website's requests.                           | Difficult      |
| Cryptography     | Cracking RSA?           | n = 1012507844500600185959897393293308058450981501, e = 65538, c = 872504627408654417593657062924385962103340788. Good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The message is encoded in octal.
