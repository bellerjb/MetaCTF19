   \Large\textbf{Gotta Go Fast!}
\end{center}

Sometimes, programmers have the need for speed. We needs fast in and even faster out. If you can't handle our speed, don't even try. To prove that you write fast code, I have this cool string that I am passing in, and I need you to tell it back to me, but I need it fast. How fast can you go? Hopefully faster than \SI{50}{\milli\second}.

\vspace*{.3in} \noindent {\large \bfseries Input Format}\\

The input will consist of a single line of text, \(s\).

\vspace*{.3in} \noindent {\large \bfseries Output Format}\\

Your output will be \(s\), but you need to be quick and send it back before the time limit runs out.
