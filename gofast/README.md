# Programming: " Gotta Go Fast!"
Sometimes, programmers have the need for speed. We needs fast in and even faster
out. If you can't handle our speed, don't even try. To prove that you write fast
code, I have this cool string that I am passing in, and I need you to tell it
back to me, but I need it fast. How fast can you go? Hopefully faster than 50ms.
